# **Issue Summary**

> Provide a brief description of what testing enhancements are needed. This could include adding new tests or improving existing tests.
> 

*Example*: Expand and refine the test suite for the `FlashcardLoginController` to include new security features and ensure comprehensive coverage of user authentication mechanisms

## **Objectives**

> Clearly state the objectives of these testing enhancements. What specific functionality or feature are these tests targeting? Why are these tests necessary?
> 

*Example*: Increase Test Coverage: Address gaps in current testing by covering new login workflows and error handling introduced in the latest update. Automate Regression

## **Testing Requirements**

> Describe in detail the requirements for the new or enhanced tests. Include specific conditions or scenarios that need to be tested.
> 

*Example*: Verify that the login process correctly handles both successful and failed logins, especially testing new error messages for account lockout scenarios.

## **Expected Outcomes**

> Describe the expected outcomes of the new or enhanced tests. What should these tests verify or validate?
> 

*Example*: All new login workflows and error handling mechanisms should be thoroughly tested and validated.

## **Possible Challenges**

> Identify any potential challenges or limitations in implementing these tests.
> 

*Example*: The increased complexity in the login process may require sophisticated testing strategies to simulate real-world usage effectively.

## **Additional Information**

> Include any other information that may be relevant to the test development process, such as dependency on other features or the need for mock data.
> 

*Example*: Mock services may be required to simulate captcha validation in test environments without depending on external services
