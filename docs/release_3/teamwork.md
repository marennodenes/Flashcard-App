# Teamwork

## Planning and Coordination Throughout the Project

At the start of our project, our planning wasn't great. We created issues that were too small, which made many tasks depend on each other. This sometimes slowed us down because we'd get stuck waiting for someone else to finish their part before we could continue. Over time, we learned to group related tasks together and think more carefully about dependencies, which made our workflow much smoother.

We also learned how important it is to write good issue and pull request descriptions. At first, we didn't see the point, but we quickly realized that clear descriptions help us work much more efficiently. We don't have to constantly ask each other what needs to be done or what's already finished, especially when we're working from different places. We even created templates for issues and pull requests to keep everything consistent.

Our team works much better when we organize tasks around pair programming. This approach is really effective for our group because when we work together, we can help each other solve problems and write better code. We also understand the code better since two people work on each part.

We now meet twice a week to stay coordinated and plan what's coming next. As the project got bigger, it became harder to keep track of all the files and components. We found that writing better JavaDoc comments helped a lot. We also started having each pair give a quick update about what they've accomplished at the start of our meetings. This way, when we're assigning new tasks, we don't waste time trying to figure out what everyone else has been working on. Between meetings, we use Messenger for quick questions and updates.

## Key Learnings from Our Experience

The biggest thing we learned is that good communication is absolutely essential. When we don't communicate well, everything becomes much harder.

Breaking down tasks into the right size is crucial. We learned that making issues too small creates unnecessary dependencies and slows down development. Grouping related tasks together and planning dependencies carefully makes the workflow much more efficient.

Good documentation makes a huge difference. Writing clear issue and pull request descriptions, using templates for consistency, and maintaining proper JavaDoc comments saves us tons of time and prevents confusion, especially when working remotely.

Pair programming is way better than working alone. We get stuck less often, make fewer mistakes, and learn more from each other.

Having structured updates during meetings is really valuable. When each pair quickly presents what they've accomplished, it keeps everyone informed and makes task delegation much faster.

We found that having regular meetings plus casual communication throughout the week works really well. The meetings keep us organized, and Messenger helps us solve small problems quickly.

This project taught us that good teamwork needs planning, regular communication, and being willing to change how we work when we find better ways to do things.
