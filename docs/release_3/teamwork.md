# Teamwork

## Planning and Coordination Throughout the Project

At the start, our planning wasn’t ideal. We created issues that were too small, causing many dependencies and slowing progress as we often had to wait for others to finish. Over time, we learned to group related tasks and plan dependencies better, which made our workflow smoother.

We also realized how important clear issue and pull request descriptions are. Initially, we didn’t prioritize them, but soon saw how they improved efficiency and reduced confusion, especially when working remotely. To stay consistent, we created templates for both.

Pair programming proved highly effective for us. Working in pairs helped solve problems faster, improved code quality, and deepened our understanding of the system since two people shared responsibility for each part.

During the project we have met twice a ween to plan and stay aligned. As the project grew, tracking all files and components became challenging, so we improved our JavaDoc comments. We gave a short update during meetings, keeping everyone informed and simplifying task assignment. Between meetings, we used Messenger for quick questions and updates.

## Key Learnings from Our Experience

Good communication is essential; when it breaks down, everything slows.
We learned to size tasks appropriately; issues that are too small create unnecessary dependencies, while grouping related ones improves efficiency.

Clear documentation saves time and prevents misunderstandings. Using templates, writing good descriptions, and maintaining JavaDoc comments keep everyone aligned.

Pair programming reduces mistakes, increases learning, and keeps work flowing.
Structured meeting updates ensure visibility, while regular meetings and casual communication complement each other.

Overall, we learned that effective teamwork depends on thoughtful planning, clear communication, and adapting our workflow when better methods emerge.
