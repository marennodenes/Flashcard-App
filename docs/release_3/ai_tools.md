# AI Tools

## Our Approach to AI in Development

We view AI as a supportive tool rather than a replacement for our coding skills. Throughout the project, we wrote most code ourselves but turned to AI assistance when stuck on specific problems or needing guidance on best practices. This approach helped us learn while maintaining productivity and code quality.

Below are the specific AI tools we used and how they contributed to our project:

## GitHub Copilot (Claude Sonnet 4.0)

- Helped generating correct dependencies management needed in the pom.xml files
- Assisted in organizing and improving test coverage across modules
- Fixed navigation bugs and UI controller logic throughout the project

- Provided guidance on Maven configuration
- Helped troubleshoot JSON serialization issues with Jackson
- Answered questions about Spring Boot configuration
- Guidance with JLink and JPackage set up

## **ChatGPT**

- Project setup and Java syntax questions
- Helped with GitHub-related questions, including commit message conventions and scoping


## **Claude AI**

- Generated Javadoc documentation for classes and methods
- Assisted with test suite organization and JUnit 5 best practices
- Helped configure JaCoCo for code coverage reporting



classes we have used ai in:
storage:
- Flashcardpersistent, spesific methods, helped us with logic with reading and writing to file, but code is written by us
    - readUserDataInternal and writeUserDataInternal
- FlashcardPersistentTest
    - cleanup(), hele er ai-generert

server: 
- UserController
    - loginUser, copilot. generated method for implementing login user and understadning what logic we need for making it work
- DeckControllerTest, FlashcardControllerTest, UserControllerTest: the whole test classes is made from copilot 
- `FlashcardServiceTest`, 
    `testGetFlashcard()`
    testGetFlashcardThrows
- UserServiceTest:
    - testCreateUserWithValidation

core:
- Password encoder: the whole class is generated by claude.ai, but explain how we  used it t identify best practise
- passwordEncoderTest: the whole class generated by claude.ai


fxui:
- FlashcardController: 
    - updateProgress()
    - updateUI()
    - flipCard(): how to handle rotate is AI

- FlashcardDeckController.java
    - whenCreateButtonIsClicked(): how to handle API endpoints whenDeleteCardButtonIsClicked() loadDeckData()

- ApiClientTest.java: the whole test - guidance on how to write correct tests for handling Api
- FlashcardDeckControllerTest: whole test
- FlashcardLoginControllerTest: whole test
- FlahscardMainControllerTest
- FlashcardSignUpControllerTest

shared:
- UserMapper: whole class, complex code, struggles, difficult
- TestMappers: all in one, used for learning how to make tests for mappers, since none of us dont know how
