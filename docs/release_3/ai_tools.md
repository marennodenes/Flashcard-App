# AI Tools

## Our Approach to AI in Development

We view AI as a supportive tool rather than a replacement for our coding skills. Throughout the project, we wrote most code ourselves but turned to AI assistance when stuck on specific problems or needing guidance on best practices. This approach helped us learn while maintaining productivity and code quality. The experience has shown us how valuable AI can be as a coding partner, and we expect to continue using these tools in our future professional work to solve complex problems more efficiently.

Below are the specific AI tools we used and how they contributed to our project:
