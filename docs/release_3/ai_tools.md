# AI Tools

## Our Approach to AI in Development

We view AI as a supportive tool rather than a replacement for our coding skills. Throughout the project, we wrote most code ourselves but turned to AI assistance when stuck on specific problems or needing guidance on best practices. This approach helped us learn while maintaining productivity and code quality. The experience has shown us how valuable AI can be as a coding partner, and we expect to continue using these tools in our future professional work to solve complex problems more efficiently.

Below are the specific AI tools we used and how they contributed to our project:

## GitHub Copilot (Claude Sonnet 4.0)

- Code cleanup and refactoring of test files (removing unnecessary comments, fixing indentation, adding public modifiers)
- Fixed package diagram dependencies to match Maven pom.xml configurations
- Created and validated UML class diagrams for all modules (fxui, core, shared, server, storage)
- Helped write comprehensive Javadoc documentation with proper @param, @return, and @throws tags
- Assisted in organizing and improving test coverage across modules
- Fixed navigation bugs and UI controller logic throughout the project

## **ChatGPT**

- Project setup and Java syntax questions
- Helped with GitHub-related questions, including commit message conventions and scoping
- Provided guidance on Maven configuration and dependency management
- Assisted with understanding Java module system and package structure
- Helped troubleshoot JSON serialization issues with Jackson
- Answered questions about REST API best practices and Spring Boot configuration

## **Claude AI**

- Architecture suggestions and code review for multi-module project structure
- Generated comprehensive Javadoc documentation for classes and methods
- Helped implement authentication system (login/signup functionality)
- Provided guidance on DTO mapping patterns and clean architecture principles
- Assisted with test suite organization and JUnit 5 best practices
- Helped configure JaCoCo for code coverage reporting
- Reviewed and suggested improvements for REST API controller implementations
