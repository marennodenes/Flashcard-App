# Commit message standard 

To maintain a consistent commit history, this project follows a standardized commit message template. The format is based on [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/), which support a clear structure, improves readability and enables automated versioning. 

## Format for Commit Messages 

Our commit messages follow the following format: 

type(scope): short description

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]


## Example of commit messages
