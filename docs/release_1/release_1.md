# Release 1

In this first milestone we started the project. Our goals for this milestone were to build the base version of our app without significant logic working. We focused mainly on the modules in our project, and implementing a starting logic.

## Modules setup

Currently we have made 3 different modules in our project

- config: store our configuration info
- core: handling all business logic in our app
- fxui: handles all the visual aspects in our app
- storage: handles persistence and stores all user data

## Making a simple text field and answer field

We made a simple javaFX window where the user can write a flashcard and submit it

## Creating logic for storing user data

The logic is handled in the core module. This includes creating a new flashcard object and a new flashcard array

The storage of data is handled in the storage module. This handles writing and reading from file, and also an csv file with user data.

## Development process

At our first group meeting we decided what our project was going to be by first brainstorming ideas, and then deciding on "note app". Then we created user stories for the application, and picked out a few which would be important for getting started on the project and which would cover the demands for release1. We also made a project on github, made todos, issues and milestones.

Then we had a meeting with our student assistant, who meant that a "note app" was a bit too simple. We agreed and brainstormed again. After that we came to the conclusion of making a flashcard/quiz app. Since we switched the app idea, we needed to make some adjustments, which we did.

## Potential improvements

As we reflect on this assignment, there are a few areas we aim to improve for future iterations.

### Task seperation

In this first release, the task separation could have been better. We have found it a bit challenging to decide who and when should work in different areas. In the future, we plan to define more distinct boundaries between tasks to avoid redundancy and ensure clearer ownership.

### Git expertise

In this first milestone, we have been introduced to working as a team on github. We have learned a lot, but still want to improve our skills. For example we need to get better at consistent structure in our commit messages and learn more about how github can be used in our team.
