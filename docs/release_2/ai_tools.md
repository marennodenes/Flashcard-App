# AI Tools 

## Our Approach to AI in Development

We view AI as a supportive tool rather than a replacement for our coding skills. Throughout the project, we wrote most code ourselves but turned to AI assistance when stuck on specific problems or needing guidance on best practices. This approach helped us learn while maintaining productivity and code quality. The experience has shown us how valuable AI can be as a coding partner, and we expect to continue using these tools in our future professional work to solve complex problems more efficiently.

Below are the specific AI tools we used and how they contributed to our project:

## GitHub Copilot (Claude Sonnet 4.0)
- Fixed navigation bugs in deck controller
- Helped implement the login system with username handling
- Updated fields in PlantUML diagrams to match project structure
- Helped improve test coverage

## **ChatGPT**: 
- Project setup and Java syntax questions
- Helped with Github related questions, for example scope in commit message 

## **Claude AI**: 
- Architecture suggestions and code review
- Generated javadoc documentation
- Helped implementing login system
