# Teamwork

## Planning and Coordination Throughout the Project

At the start of our project, our planning was not optimal. We created issues that were too small, which made many tasks highly dependent on each other. This sometimes slowed down our development because progress on one task was blocked by another. Over time, we learned to group related tasks and plan dependencies more carefully, which improved our workflow and efficiency.

We learned to work better by dividing tasks into pairs. Pair programming works really well for our group. When we work together, we can help each other with problems and write better code. We also understand the code better since two people work on each part.

We now meet twice a week to stay connected and plan what to do next. Between meetings, we use Messenger to ask quick questions and share updates.

## Key Learnings from Our Experience

The most important thing we learned is that good communication is essential. When we don't talk enough, everything becomes harder.

Working in pairs is much better than working alone. We get stuck less often and make fewer mistakes. It's also easier to learn from each other this way.

We found that having regular meetings plus quick messages throughout the week works well. The meetings keep us organized, and Messenger helps us solve small problems fast.

This project taught us that good teamwork needs planning, regular communication, and willingness to change how we work when we find better ways.
